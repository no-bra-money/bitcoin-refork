bitcoin-refork - Alt-Fork your own $BTCxxxx, as empty or partial (dated bitcoin-core block)...  
=============================================
Project to 'Alt-Fork' (File-Diff/Re-Gen of) Bitcoin-Core $BTC code, but 'empty' bar genesis or partial-coins up to dated block.
Makes no more sense to double-reward holders, than it does to double-spend; so make a limited decision.

Plan to implement AI-agents to 'File-Diff', and log recommended changes: which need to be verified by Humans.

Donations of bitcoin $BTC, fiat etc most welcome to progress this project; which is in parallel with a new ALT-Coin
project & protocol; just needed a working version of Bitcoin to integrate with, and no-idea why someone else hasn't made this 
re-forkable as clean your own project; seems as if Bitcoin-Core and those holding BTC wanted to obstruct such clones (imho).

De-Dollarise World-Trade by 24-year '(shadow) staFle-coin' morph to National/Federal $BTC-xxx 'Reserve-Bank' Treasuries,
scaled towards a 2050 World-Fed, alongside existing 'stateless' Crypto... 
=============================================

(2026 Valentine's) Re-Fork is a new (2026) ambitious crypto-punk project, to enable 'financial rebels' to replace $USD.

The USA represents 3.5% of World-Population, but post 1944 Bretton-Woods, dictated much post-WW2 Global-Trade Currency.
That places the USA at an unfair advantage, and has lead to deficits, in part funded by everyone else.

With the fall of Syrian and other Middle-Eastern / African Regimes, maybe it's time to write-off many national-debts,
and in the future including your local 'Any Country-Bank' Fiat/CBDC.

As taxes on you rise, they're divorced from any meaningful, descreasing public services to you, or benefits for your family.

Oligarchs and Billionaires are grabbing everything, including money / crypto itself. It's time for an alternative 
'Great Reset', not by vested interests, but by the 'little guy'.

Pensions are not buckets of your worked for money, they're paid out and robbed by others; often by corrupt politicians:
such as (UK) Covid-PPE contracts, to operations set up by a minister's neighbour. No open, fair Public-Tender.
That's wrong, taxpayer and pension funds should be in trust.

In response to Donald Trump threatening to invade Greenland (and steal its resources) before anyone else.
Ditto Russia-Ukraine, ditto China-Taiwan etc...
Similarly Catalonia was refused Independence vote, based on 'Spanish' Constitutional Treaty;
just as United States' stopped Confederate States from ceding from its 'Federal Union';
but England has Magna-Carta fair trial ignored by UK, even though EWHC/RCJ court devolved decision to USA.

  (1) Software tool lets the 'mother-f*rker' create an unspendable genesis-block with rest of blockchain empty, or...
      (future-option) adopts a partial (dated bitcoin-core block) acceptance of existing issued, transacted, seized
      or otherwise coins (Extrajudicial seizure /sanction abroad is not condoned, but neither is controlled;
      it's just copied as of the date & time of bitcoin core. This can allow others to take their own alternative
      view on such practices, without needing to 'take sides'); or...
      (future-option) adopt other cryptocurrency blockchains, when compatible or convertible by suitable code.
  (2) Issuance and controlling of the subsequent minting of cryptocurrency, including but not limited to coins, notes,

  (5) This is a tool, and does not prescribe, nor take responsibility for what anyone does with their generated instance.
  (6) Any change within copied Bitcoin-Core code, should be clearly identified, with 'bitcoin-refork:' along with
      'comment: {reason, change-Ref-ID}', 'comment: removed this code...{bitcoin-code}', 'comment: added...',
      then... (actual) {refork-code}... 'comment: {End of refork-code, change-Ref-ID}';
      also a Diff(erence) source-code file needs to be generated, changes (preferably independently)verified,

  (7) Please email or pull any suggestions, during development, citing 'which-project','file','heading/para',line etc:
      and giving a snappy short title less than 120 characters, and no more than an initial 1000 words description;
      or as limited by respitory.
  (8) Within 'reasonable-time' (commensurate with support resources) a governance board or DAO should take over this project;
      and in the event of no changes within 1 year, it's fair-game to locate any passwords, keys, control etc.

Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

For an immediately usable, binary version of the Bitcoin Core software, see
https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/.

What is Bitcoin Core?
---------------------

Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully
validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user
interface, which can be optionally built.

Further information about Bitcoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/license/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository is used exclusively for the
development of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree
repositories. Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork
that repository unless it is for development reasons.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled during the generation of the build system) with: `ctest`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `build/test/functional/test_runner.py`
(assuming `build` is your build directory).

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is tested on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
The CI must pass on all commits before merge to avoid unrelated CI failures on new pull requests.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://explore.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
