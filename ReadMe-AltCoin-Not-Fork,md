Re-Fork is neither hard-, nor soft-fork, but Alt-Coin re-using Blockchain code with checks tweaked.

A soft-fork results in only 1 blockchain; whereas a hard-fork creates 2 where there was 1.

Soft forks and hard forks are software / protocol upgrades to a blockchain,
that differ in compatibility and impact.

Soft Fork: A backward-compatible upgrade. where new rules are stricter than old ones.
Newer versions check for the feature, and adapt accordingly.
Nodes not upgraded can still validate new blocks, so the network remains unified. 
It does not create a new blockchain or new tokens.  
  Example: Bitcoin’s SegWit upgrade improved scalability without splitting the chain. 

Hard Fork: A non-backward-compatible change that creates a permanent split. 
Nodes must upgrade to stay on the new chain. If not, they remain on the original chain, 
resulting in two separate blockchains and two separate cryptocurrencies.  
  Example: Bitcoin Cash was created from a hard fork of Bitcoin, 
           giving existing holders of Bitcoin, an equivalent extra amount of Bitcoin Cash;
           to some this seems a repeat of the Double-Spend problem, unduely burdening it. 

Alt-Coin: A different Genesis-Block,and thus Blockchain:

Re-Fork: If a Blockchain re-uses Blockchain code (with only necessary tweaks), 
but renews Genesis-Block and Code / Genesis-Block Verification, then techincally it's 
an (Alt-Coin) Re-Fork.
